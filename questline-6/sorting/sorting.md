I chose Bubble Sort because it is simple to implement and easy to understand.  
It repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.  
Although not the most efficient sorting algorithm  it is suitable for small lists like [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6].
