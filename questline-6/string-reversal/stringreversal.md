in the interative method we need to perform a loop and iterate through every element
first i created a for loop in such a way that it returns the string from the last ie, for i in range(len(s)-1,-1,-1)  {let len(s) be the length of the string}
now i can call an empty string string and the elements in the loop to the empty string which results in the reversal of string

recursive method is easy because you just have to assign a variable to input the string reversed by string slicing ie, let a variable be r then 
we can assign r=s[::-1]  {let s be a string}
