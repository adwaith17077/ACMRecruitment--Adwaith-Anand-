    l = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
    n = len(l)
    
    def arrayrotation(k):
        L = [0] * n   
        for i in range(n):
            new= (i + k) % n   
            L[new] = l[i]
        return L
    
    
    #1
    k = 2
    print("original array =", l)
    print("array when rotated by", k, "=", arrayrotation(k))
    
    #2
    k = 4
    print("original array =", l)
    print("array when rotated by", k, "=", arrayrotation(k))

this is the code i created to rotate array by k steps.in this code we first define a funstion so that is easy to use
multiple value for k. we assign a new list with 1 element of ur choice and multiply by the length of the original lsit
to get a list with same number of elements, then i created a loop in which i assigned a variable (i+k)%n to create the
index for a character to be placed after rotation in the new list as shown in line 8.
