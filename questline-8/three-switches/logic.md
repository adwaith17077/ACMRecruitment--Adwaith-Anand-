the task has not specified what all i can bring, so if i am able to bring along anything i want then i can take 
2 smartphone video call eachother and place one phone in the room with the bulb without switching off the video
and now i can enter the other room and turn on the switches and check which switch turns on the bulb through the video call

if i dont have 2 smartphone then i will use heat of the bulb to determine which switch turns on the bulb
i will first enter the room with the switch then i turn switch 1 out of the 3 for like 10 or 15 minutes if this switch is connected to the bulb then the bulb will be a bit hot,so after 15 minutes i will turn off switch one and turn on switch 2 instantly leaving switch 3 off 
then i will check the other room quickly if the bulb is glowing then switch 2 is connected to the bulb 
if the bulb is not glowing and the bulb is a bit hot then switch 1 is conected to bulb and if it is cold then switch 3 is connected to the bulb
