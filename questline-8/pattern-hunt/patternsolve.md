the given pattern is 2,6,12,20,..
as you can see difference between the adjacent terms is in the pattern 4,6,8,.. which  adds on by 2 so the rest of the difference pattern will be 4,6,8,10,12,...
so applying the differnce pattern to the main pattern we get 2,6,12,20,30,42,..
hence the rest of the two terrms are

30 and 42
